# Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

These inspections allow you to monitor the _Availability_ and _Latency_ SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for every application. 
By default, Coroot tracks the application layer metrics gathered by coroot-node-gent, but you can replace them with your custom Prometheus metrics.

## Availability

The predefined `Availability` SLO: 99% of requests should be server without errors.
You can easily adjust the objective:

...or configure Coroot to rack your custom Prometheus metrics:

## Latency

The predefined `Latency` SLO: 99% of requests should be served in less that 500ms.

You can also define any Prometheus [histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms/) to be used instead of the built-in metrics:

## Kubernetes annotations

You can define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) using annotations on Kubernetes objects such as Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, or CronJob.
Only SLO thresholds are defined via annotations â€” Coroot uses its eBPF-based metrics to calculate the corresponding Service Level Indicators (SLIs).

Application latency in Coroot is represented as a histogram with a fixed set of buckets: `5ms, 10ms, 25ms, 50ms, 100ms, 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 2.5s, 5s, 10s`.
When evaluating SLO compliance, Coroot compares the number of requests that meet the latency objective to the total number of requests.
Therefore, the `slo-latency-threshold` value must match one of the predefined buckets.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: some-app
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    coroot.com/slo-availability-objective: 99.9%
    coroot.com/slo-latency-objective: 99.9%
    coroot.com/slo-latency-threshold: 100ms
```
Once SLOs are defined through annotations, they cannot be edited in the UI.

To disable a specific SLO for an application, set its objective to `0%`:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: some-app
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    coroot.com/slo-availability-objective: 99%
    coroot.com/slo-latency-objective: 0% # Latency SLO is disabled
```

Defining custom SLI metrics via annotations is not supported yet.
