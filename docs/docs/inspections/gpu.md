# GPU 

Coroot provides real-time visibility into GPU usage across your applications, helping you understand performance bottlenecks, 
detect resource contention, and optimize workloads running on GPU-enabled nodes.

## Overview

The **GPU** tab in the Application view (e.g., `ollama`) shows detailed metrics collected from NVIDIA GPUs used by your workloads. 
These metrics include both per-application and global GPU stats, presented in easy-to-read time-series charts.

## Dashboard

### GPU Usage by Application (%)
Shows the percentage of GPU compute resources used by each instance of the application (e.g., `ollama-56b6fd44bc-4zlvq`). 
This reflects SM (streaming multiprocessor) usage.

### GPU Memory Usage by Application (%)
Tracks how much GPU memory is used by each application container, expressed as a percentage of total available memory.

### GPU Utilization (%)
Displays the overall utilization of the GPU's compute resources, averaged across all consumers. 
This helps identify how busy the GPU is during the observed timeframe.

### GPU Memory Utilization (%)
Indicates how much of the GPU memory is in use, averaged across the timeframe. Spikes here can indicate memory-heavy operations like loading large models.

### GPU Consumers
Breaks down GPU utilization by each container using the GPU. This provides transparency into which workloads are actively consuming compute resources.

### GPU Memory Consumers
Shows how GPU memory is distributed across running containers. Useful for detecting memory-hungry processes.

### GPU Temperature (Â°C)
Reports the real-time operating temperature of the GPU. Overheating may suggest thermal throttling or cooling issues.

### GPU Power Usage (Watts)
Displays the power consumption of the GPU in watts. Power spikes usually correlate with high GPU utilization or memory usage.
