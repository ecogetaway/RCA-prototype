# Querying

Logs can be filtered by severity, message content, and attributes.

Coroot supports the `=` (equal), `~` (regex match), `!=` (not equal), and `!~` (regex not match) operators for attributes, 
and the `üîç` (contains) operator for message body.
Under the hood, the `contains` operator uses token-based search with ClickHouse full-text indexes for improved performance.

All positive filters (`=`, `~`) with the same attribute name are combined using `OR`, while negative filters (`!=`, `!~`) are combined using `AND`.

To make filtering easier, Coroot provides suggestions for attribute names and values.

Filters can also be added from the log message details by clicking the `+` (add to search) or `‚Äì` (exclude from search) buttons.
