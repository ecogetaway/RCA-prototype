# Application Categories

Coroot allows you to organize your applications into custom groups called Application Categories. 
These act like scopes, helping you either hide certain applications or focus on specific ones more easily.
Additionally, Application Categories can be used for [notification routing](#notification-routing) â€” for example, to send alerts to different Slack channels based on category.

## Kubernetes annotations

To define a category for a Kubernetes application (Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, or CronJob),
annotate it with the `coroot.com/application-category` annotation.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: some-app
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    coroot.com/application-category: auxiliary
```

The application category can also be defined using Pod annotations.

## Pattern-based configuration

For non-Kubernetes applications, or in cases where setting annotations is not possible, 
Coroot allows you to configure Application Categories manually by matching applications using patterns.

:::info
Application categories defined via annotations take precedence over those configured manually.
:::

To configure Application Categories, go to the **Project Settings**, click on **Applications**, and adjust the 
built-in categories or create your own custom ones. 
Each category is defined by a set of [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) in the `<namespace>/<application_name>` format.

Coroot also includes several pre-defined categories, such as `monitoring` and `control-plane`.

## Quick links

To make organizing your apps easier, Coroot allows you to define the category for an app directly on the service map:

... or application page:

## Notification routing

A category can be configured to enable or disable notifications about incidents (SLO violations) and new deployments.
