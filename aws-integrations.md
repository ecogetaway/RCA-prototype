# AWS Agentic AI Integrations

## Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
- Deployed for secure, scalable AI agents.
- Handles dynamic orchestration: alert correlation, enrichment, automated decision-making.
- AgentCore Gateway transforms data sources (e.g., coroot metrics) into agent tools.

## Strands Agents SDK
- Open-source SDK for building model-driven AI agents.
- Autonomous agents for:
  - Multi-step alert processing.
  - Infrastructure drift detection.
  - AI-driven summarization and RCA.
- Integrates with AWS services and foundation models.

## Keep Integration
- Connects with Keep's existing AI backends.
- Ensures seamless workflow between coroot RCA and Keep's alert management.
- Agents interact with Keep for enhanced alert handling.

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up AWS Bedrock and AgentCore.
2. Integrate Strands Agents in coroot backend.
3. Connect to Keep via APIs.
4. Test agent workflows for RCA and alerts.
